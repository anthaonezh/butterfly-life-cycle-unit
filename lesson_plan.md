# The Life Cycle of a Butterfly - Lesson Plan

## Overview
This lesson introduces students to the four stages of the butterfly life cycle through multi‑sensory, hands‑on activities designed for K‑2 students with special needs.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify and sequence the four stages: egg, caterpillar (larva), chrysalis (pupa), butterfly (adult).
- Use vocabulary such as “metamorphosis,” “chrysalis,” and “larva” in context.
- Participate in a sensory‑rich activity that models the transformation from caterpillar to chrysalis.

## Materials Needed
- Picture cards of each life‑cycle stage
- “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” by Eric Carle
- Modeling clay (unscented, allergen‑free)
- Small toy figures (e.g., plastic caterpillars)
- Textured fabrics (silk, burlap) to represent different stages
- Visual schedule board with Velcro icons

## Activity 1: Introduction and Story Time
Read “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” aloud, pausing to point out the caterpillar, the “cocoon” (chrysalis), and the emerging butterfly. Use picture cards to reinforce each stage.

## Activity 2: Clay Chrysalis Sensory Experience
**Purpose:** To give students a tactile, concrete understanding of how a caterpillar forms a chrysalis.

**Procedure:**
1. Give each student a small ball of soft modeling clay.
2. Have them flatten the clay into a “leaf.”
3. Place a small toy caterpillar on the leaf.
4. Show students how to gently wrap the clay around the caterpillar, forming a protective chrysalis.
5. Encourage them to feel the smooth, cool exterior of the clay and talk about how the real chrysalis protects the caterpillar while it changes.
6. After a few minutes, students can “hatch” their butterfly by carefully peeling the clay apart and replacing the caterpillar with a toy butterfly.

**Differentiation:**
- For students with fine‑motor challenges, provide pre‑rolled clay or use larger toys.
- For visually impaired learners, add scents (e.g., a drop of lavender oil on the clay) to associate the chrysalis with a calming smell.
- Use a social story or video model before the activity for students who benefit from previewing steps.

## Activity 3: Sequencing and Vocabulary Practice
Using the picture cards and Velcro schedule board, students place the stages in order while repeating the key words: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly.

## Assessment
- Observe whether students can name each stage when shown a picture.
- Note participation and engagement during the clay activity.
- Collect anecdotal records of vocabulary use.

## Extension Ideas
- Visit a butterfly garden (virtual or in‑person).
- Grow live caterpillars in the classroom (order a butterfly kit).
- Create a class “Butterfly Life Cycle” mural with textured materials.
